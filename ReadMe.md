ANALOG SIGNAL DETECTION AND RAPID RESPONSE SYSTEM

A twin platform system based out of QNX purple box and Freescale board. The QNX
board detects an analog voltage supplied to it, which is quantized, range checked and
then communicated to the Freescale board. The Freescale board receives the data from
the QNX, interprets and diagnoses the signal before providing visual indication of the
received data on a PWM controlled servo motor
