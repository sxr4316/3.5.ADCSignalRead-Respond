A stand-alone QNX C/C++ program triggers an ultrasonic range finder with a digital pulse lasting less than 1ms and determines the distance between the sensor and the obstacle based on the echo pulse generated by the ultrasonic transceiver. The distance is measured based on the time between the transmission of the pulse to the detection of the first wave front arriving back at the sensor.
